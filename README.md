## CI Memes

Example repository demonstrating Solano CI integration with Amazon EC2 Container Registry (ECR)
and Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS). See docker pull, build, test, and push. When configured
it will also deploy to AWS EC2 Container Service (ECS). See http://blog.solanolabs.com/ for more
information.

Technologies used:

- Docker
- AWS EC2 Container Registry (ECR)
- AWS EC2 Container Service (ECS)
- Nginx
- Mysql (only used for example purposes. Many "lighter" solutions would be more appropriate in this use case.)
